API Documentation: https://happyrobot-usecase-e1d892c0f5a0.herokuapp.com/docs#/

This API, built with FastAPI, uses a CSV file (loads.csv) to store load details and provides three main endpoints: POST /loads, POST /verify-carrier, and POST /evaluate-offer.

For load lookup, send a JSON body like:
{
  "reference_number": "REF09460"
}
The API normalizes the reference number (removing "REF" and leading zeros) and returns the load details (fields: reference_number, origin, destination, equipment_type, rate, commodity).

For carrier verification, send:
{
  "mc_number": "MC123456"
}
This simulates verifying a carrier against a preset list and returns whether the carrier is verified along with the carrier name.

For offer evaluation, send:
{
  "carrier_offer": 600,
  "our_last_offer": 700,
  "offer_attempt": 1
}
The API responds with a JSON object indicating the result ("accept" or "counter"), the new offer value, and a message.

The CSV file must have the following columns:
reference_number, origin, destination, equipment_type, rate, commodity
For example:
REF09460, Denver, CO, Detroit, MI, Dry Van, 868, Automotive Parts
REF04684, Dallas, TX, Chicago, IL, Dry Van or Flatbed, 570, Agricultural Products
REF09690, Detroit, MI, Nashville, TN, Dry Van, 1495, Industrial Equipment
